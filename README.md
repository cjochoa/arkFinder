# arkFinder

The [https://odata.intel.com/Documentation](odata) web API  from Intel is powered by [ark.intel.com](http://ark.intel.com/) and provides IntelÂ® product specifications through a RESTful web API.

In this script, we use curl to download a JSON DB (see DB_R2\history), and we access the offline DB thru Python, instead of online accessing Odata's Restful API.
